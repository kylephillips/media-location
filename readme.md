# Media Location - A WordPress Plugin
This plugin adds a Google Maps places field to the media attachment edit interface. This enables the saving of places as post meta along with the attachment (Facebook-style photo tagging of places).

This plugin is still under its initial development.

### Requirements
* **Google Maps API Key** - The key must have the Javascript Maps and Places APIs enabled, and have an associated billing method.
